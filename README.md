# Football Analysis using Computer Vision with Yolov8 & OpenCV

## üìñ Project Overview
This project leverages **deep learning** techniques for **football video analysis**, focusing on tracking players and the ball during a match. Using **Yolov8** for object detection and **OpenCV** for computer vision tasks, this application extracts player and ball coordinates, projects them onto a tactical map, and provides real-time insights for football analysis.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Player and Ball Detection**: Detect players, referees, and the ball from football game footage.
- **Tactical Map Projection**: Map player and ball coordinates onto a tactical map using homography transformation.
- **Team Affiliation Prediction**: Identify teams based on color analysis and assign players accordingly.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Frame-by-frame tracking of player movements and ball trajectory for real-time insights.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Model**: [YOLOv8](https://yolov8.com/) (You Only Look Once - Version 8) for object detection.
- **Computer Vision Library**: [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for video processing and homography matrix calculations.
- **Programming Language**: Python.
- **Other Libraries**:
  - **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For clustering algorithms in team prediction.
  - **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visual representation.
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms and Techniques
- **Object Detection**: Uses **YOLOv8** for detecting players, referees, and the ball from football match videos.
- **Homography Transformation**: Calculates a **homography matrix** to map player and ball positions from the video frame to a tactical map.
- **Team Prediction Algorithm**: Uses **color analysis** to predict which team each player belongs to, based on dominant colors in the player's uniform.
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Implements **K-means clustering** to assist in team prediction by grouping players based on color similarities.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Data Input**: Input football match video recordings into the system.
2. **Object Detection**: Yolov8 detects players, referees, and the ball.
3. **Coordinate Projection**: The detected objects' coordinates are projected onto a tactical map using a homography transformation.
4. **Team Identification**: The color of each player is analyzed, and a team is assigned based on the dominant color palette extracted from the player's uniform.
5. **Visualization**: The processed data is displayed as real-time updates on the tactical map.

## üìä Datasets
The project uses a **custom dataset** of football videos with annotated player and ball positions. The dataset is manually labeled to train the YOLOv8 model for better performance on player and ball detection.

## üí° Challenges
- **Class Imbalance**: The ball appears less frequently than players in the dataset, causing detection difficulties.
- **Camera Movement**: Sudden changes in the video frame (due to camera movements) can affect detection and homography transformations.
- **Team Differentiation**: Accurately separating players of opposing teams in similar lighting conditions and from distant camera angles is challenging.
